Description: The 'JSON' format is ubiquitous for data interchange, and the
 'simdjson' library written by Daniel Lemire (and many contributors) provides a
 high-performance parser for these files which by relying on parallel 'SIMD'
 instruction manages to parse these files as faster than disk speed. See the
 <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1902.08318> paper for more details about 'simdjson'.  This
 package parses 'JSON' from string, file, or remote URLs under a variety of
 settings.
