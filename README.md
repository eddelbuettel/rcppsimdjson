### Motivation

[simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) by [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/en/) (with contributions by [Geoff
Langdale](https://branchfree.org/),  [John Keiser](https://github.com/jkeiser) and  [many others](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/graphs/contributors)) is an
engineering marvel.  Through very clever use of [SIMD instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD),
it manages to parse JSON files faster than disc access. Wut? Yes you read that right: parallel
processing with so little overhead that the net throughput is limited only by disk speed.

Moreover, it is implemented in neat modern C++ and can be accessed as a header-only library. (Well,
one library in two files, really.)  Which makes R packaging easy and convenient and compelling. So
here we are.

For further introduction, see the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318) by Langdale and Lemire (out/to appear in VLDB
Journal 28(6) as well) and/or the video of the [recent talk by Daniel Lemire at
QCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlvKAT7SZIQ) (voted best talk).

### Example

```r
jsonfile <- system.file("jsonexamples", "twitter.json", package="RcppSimdJson")
library(RcppSimdJson)
validateJSON(jsonfile)                  # validate a JSON file
res <- fload(jsonfile)                  # parse a JSON file
```

### Comparison

A [simple parsing benchmark](demo/simpleBenchmark.R) against four other R-accessible JSON parsers:

```r

Unit: milliseconds
     expr      min       lq     mean   median       uq       max neval  cld

### Status

As of version 0.1.0, all three major OSs are supported, and JSON can be parsed from file and string
under a variety of settings. Prefers a real C++17 compiler but can fall back to older
compiler. Still subject to change.

### Contributing

Any problems, bug reports, or features requests for the package can be submitted and handled most
conveniently as [Github issues](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppsimdjson/issues) in the repository.

Before submitting pull requests, it is frequently preferable to first discuss need and scope in such
an issue ticket.  See the file
[Contributing.md](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/blob/master/Contributing.md) (in the
[Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) repo) for a brief discussion.
